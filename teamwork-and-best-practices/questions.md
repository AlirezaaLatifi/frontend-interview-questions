### 1. What are some best practices you follow when writing React code in a team environment?

- **Component Organization:** I follow a feature-based folder structure (e.g., `src/features/Todo/`) to group related components, styles, and tests together, improving modularity and maintainability.
- **Component Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for components and hooks (`UserCard`, `useFetchUser`), and follow PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions.
- **State Management:** I localize state as much as possible. For global state, I opt for tools like **Redux Toolkit** , **Zustand** , or **React Context** based on complexity.
- **Prop Drilling Avoidance:** For deeply nested components, I extract logic into context or custom hooks.
- **Hooks and Logic Reuse:** Business logic goes into custom hooks (`useForm`, `useDebounce`) for reuse and testability.
- **Code Review Culture:** I advocate for regular PR reviews with enforced CI linting/tests to ensure code quality and team alignment.

### 2. How do you ensure your React code is clean, readable, and follows consistent standards?

**Approach:**

- **Linting & Formatting:** I use **ESLint** (with Airbnb or custom config) and **Prettier** integrated into the dev workflow (CI + IDE) to enforce consistent syntax and formatting.
- **Typescript:** I strongly prefer TypeScript to improve clarity and prevent runtime bugs via static typing.

**Functional Components & Hooks:** I write components as pure functions and avoid class components unless legacy code demands it.

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each component handles a single concern. If a component grows too large, I refactor UI/logic into subcomponents or custom hooks.
- **Naming & Semantics:** Descriptive naming, semantic HTML (`<section>`, `<article>`), and ARIA attributes for accessibility.

**Example:**

```tsx
const UserList = ({ users }: { users: User[] }) => (
  <ul>
    {users.map((user) => (
      <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

Clean, typed, and simple.

### 3. How do you handle version control and collaboration on a React project with multiple developers?

**Practices:**

- **Git Workflow:** I follow **Git Flow** or **GitHub Flow** , with short-lived feature branches (`feature/login-page`), pull requests, and code reviews.
- **Branch Protection & CI:** Enforce PR reviews, automated tests, and linting before merging via tools like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.
- **Code Ownership:** Components and features are owned by specific developers or squads. Ownership reduces ambiguity and speeds up reviews.
- **Documentation:** I document component APIs and usage patterns via Storybook or internal docs to ease onboarding and collaboration.
- **Merge Conflicts:** Regularly pull and rebase from `main` or `develop` to avoid large conflicts and integration surprises.

<br />

### 4. How do you stay updated with the latest changes in React and frontend development?

**Strategies:**

- **Official Channels:** Follow the React blog, GitHub discussions, and RFCs for upcoming features and direction (e.g., React Server Components).
- **Curated Newsletters:** Subscribe to _React Status_ , _Frontend Focus_ , and _JavaScript Weekly_ .
- **Communities:** Engage in dev Twitter, Stack Overflow, and Reddit to stay on top of ecosystem tools (e.g., Vite, TanStack, SWR).
- **Experimentation:** I regularly prototype with new libraries or patterns in side projects or Codesandbox experiments.
- **Conferences & Talks:** Watch talks from ReactConf, JSConf, and local meetups. I also occasionally present findings back to the team.

### 5. How do you ensure your React components are reusable and maintainable?

**Key Techniques:**

- **Separation of Concerns:** I separate presentation (dumb) and container (smart) components. Presentational components receive all data via props.
- **Custom Hooks:** Abstract shared logic into hooks. Example: `useFormValidation`, `usePagination`, etc.
- **Composable Props:** Use props like `renderItem`, `children`, or `as` to make components extensible.

**Example:**

```tsx
const List = ({
  items,
  renderItem,
}: {
  items: T[];
  renderItem: (item: T) => React.ReactNode;
}) => <ul>{items.map(renderItem)}</ul>;
```

- **Prop Types & Defaults:** Use TypeScript interfaces and sensible defaults to make components self-documenting.
- **Avoid Over-abstracting:** Components should be generalized **only** when thereâ€™s a clear reuse case, avoiding premature generalization.
- **Testing:** Each reusable component is covered with unit tests using **React Testing Library** , ensuring they work as expected across use cases.
