### How do you evaluate the potential of WebAssembly in a React application?

**Answer:**

I consider WebAssembly (Wasm) when performance-critical tasks arise, such as video processing, math-heavy computations, or image manipulation. I evaluate:

- Whether native languages (e.g., Rust, C++) outperform JS significantly
- If existing JS bottlenecks justify the complexity

Example:

Using Rust-compiled Wasm to compress images client-side:

```jsx
import initWasm from "./wasm/image_compression";
useEffect(() => {
  initWasm().then(() => compressImage(file));
}, []);
```

Integration is seamless via async modules, especially in Web Workers.

### What’s your take on the rise of server components in React (e.g., Next.js Server Components)?

**Answer:**

Server Components (RSC) enable partial server-side rendering without shipping unnecessary JS to the client. I see them as a **powerful performance win** for data-heavy UIs with minimal interactivity.

Benefits:

- Zero JS bundle for server-rendered UI
- Reduced hydration cost
- Better backend data access (e.g., directly hitting DB)

Caveat: adoption requires architectural rethink and clear separation of client vs server logic.

### How do you prepare a React codebase for adopting emerging CSS features (e.g., Container Queries)?

**Answer:**

- Use **utility-first or scoped CSS** (e.g., Tailwind, CSS Modules) to reduce global conflicts
- Abstract layout logic to centralized components
- Use **feature detection** and progressive enhancement:

```css
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    font-size: 1.2rem;
  }
}
```

- Fall back to polyfills (e.g., `cqfill`) if needed for legacy browsers
- Stay modular—easier to refactor styles when new features land

### What’s your approach to integrating AI-driven features (e.g., chatbots, personalization) into a React app?

**Answer:**

- I treat AI features as **modular services** , often isolated from core UI:
  - Chatbot via WebSocket → `useEffect` hook + state manager
  - Personalization via feature flags or inference-based rendering

Example:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch("/api/recommendations?user=123")
    .then((res) => res.json())
    .then(setSuggestions);
}, []);
```

I prioritize **latency** , **fallbacks** , and **ethical UX** (clear feedback, no hallucination).

### How do you assess the impact of new JavaScript ECMAScript proposals on a React project?

**Answer:**
I follow TC39 stages and evaluate:

- Stage 3+ proposals for practical experimentation
- Browser + build tool support (e.g., Vite/Babel)
- Developer productivity vs risk

Example: **Records & Tuples** bring structural immutability, helpful in reducer logic.

I experiment in side projects, and if adoption is promising, introduce via `babel-plugin-proposal-*`.

### What’s your strategy for future-proofing a React app against framework obsolescence?

**Answer:**

- Encapsulate logic (e.g., services, hooks, state) from framework specifics
- Follow **standards-first** (e.g., Web Components, native Fetch)
- Use abstractions for routers, forms, state—easy to swap:

```jsx
// src/hooks/useUser.ts
export const useUser = () => useQuery("user", fetchUser);
```

- Avoid tightly coupling to unstable APIs or private internals

This enables migration (e.g., to Next.js or Astro) with lower friction.

### How do you leverage modern browser APIs (e.g., Intersection Observer, WebGPU) in a React app?

**Answer:**
I use:

- `IntersectionObserver` for lazy loading or infinite scroll:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback);
  observer.observe(ref.current);
}, []);
```

- `WebGPU` (where supported) for advanced rendering or ML workloads—modularized in a `useCanvasRenderer()` hook

Always wrapped in `useEffect` or custom hooks with feature detection:

```jsx
if ("gpu" in navigator) {
  /* WebGPU logic */
}
```

### What’s your take on the evolution of state management libraries beyond Redux and Zustand?

**Answer:**
The trend is toward **lightweight** , **scalable** , and **reactive** tools:

- **Jotai/Recoil** : atomic, scoped reactivity
- **React Query/TanStack Query** : server-state management
- **Signals (Preact, Angular)** hint at future React models

I prioritize **cohesiveness with React mental model** and **low boilerplate** . Zustand remains my default for simplicity unless global effects or optimistic updates require more.

### How do you stay ahead of frontend trends while maintaining stability in a production React app?

**Answer:**

- Follow **RFCs** , changelogs, and core team members (Dan Abramov, etc.)
- Isolate experiments in sandboxes/feature branches
- Maintain a **tech radar** : experiment → evaluate → incubate → adopt
- Use **feature flags** and **canary releases** for safe rollout
- Ensure CI coverage and monitoring guard production from regressions

### How do you mentor a team to adopt emerging technologies in a React codebase responsibly?

**Answer:**

- Lead by prototyping new tech with real business use cases
- Run **tech spikes** and **internal talks** with pros/cons
- Document patterns (e.g., how to use Server Components)
- Pair program to build confidence
- Establish **adoption criteria** : maturity, ecosystem support, impact

I encourage curiosity balanced by pragmatism: tech should solve problems, not introduce new ones.
